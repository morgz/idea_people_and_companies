Their communication are a bit sparse and the Medium and Twitter aren't regurlary updated so it's hard to tell how the company is going.

>HYPE has become the UK’s most inspiring story of student entrepreneurship. When Aidy Lennox and Liam Green started the fashion brand in 2011, few could have predicted that retail giants including Topman, Footasylum and Asos would join the ride.   
Liam Green was only 17-years-old when HYPE was born, preparing to begin university at De Montfort in Leicester, where he’d start to realise his ambitions as a graphic designer. However after an initial investment of £400 between Liam and his partner Aidy resulted in the first wave of HYPE designs selling out within hours, both realised that bigger things were on the horizon.

Love his twitter. He looks like an authentic mess, or exactly what you'd expect from a rich teenager.

 >BORN FROM THE PIONEERING CULTURE OF EAST LONDON, WE BRING TOGETHER OUR CLIENTS AND ARTISTS TO DELIVER BESPOKE, UNIQUE ENTERTAINMENT   
 
 >Radio and TV presenter Fearne Cotton has invested in East Creative Agency, the company launched by former Radio 1 producer Amy Redmond and business partners Jamie Tagg and Glyn Fussell.   
Since its launch in 2014, the talent agency, which creates specialist bespoke entertainment and content, has grown to include Defected Records, Bestival, Google, MasterCard and a roster of London night club brands such as Sink The Pink, Rebel Bingo and Guilty Pleasures on its client list.   Redmond previously worked at Radio 1 for 10 years, while Tagg, a former DJ agent, looked after presenters like Nick Grimshaw and Chris Stark.   
With Cotton joining, the agency hopes to extend its relations in the commercial sector. 

Tagg said “We’ve had some great collaborations this year with the likes of Defected, Todd Terje and most recently Years & Years. With Fearne now an invested part of the agency, we’re looking forward to developing these relationships into the live and commercial sector as well as a new joint venture we’ll be launching in early 2016.”

**Fuzzy Navigation** - What a cool term... Basic idea is you get a heading and distance on your handle bars. That's it. No panicking over choosing the right road from your google maps but just enough information to get you to your destination while allowing you to choose your path and explore.

Currently at £140,000 on kickstarter smashing their goal of £60K.

##Matt Webb

I've always been a big fan of the work BERG did until it shut shop recently. They created some great tech ideas with compelling concept videos and prototypes. 



>Interests: technology and design and business strategy; Internet of Things products and how to make them. Regular event speaker (Sydney, Osaka, Miami) and occasional writer. Big supporter/advisor to hardware startups and London's startup ecosystem, occasional small angel.

>Currently independent consultant and working on new ventures. Ex UK government. Ex Techstars. Ex Berg (co-founder) which has had an awesome history and built things I never thought possible (including the design, build, manufacture and support of one of the world's first consumer Internet of Things devices, from hardware to cloud and everything else). Fast Company placed Berg as one of the world's 50 most innovative companies. We got work in the permanent collection of the New York MoMA.

>Co-author of Mind Hacks way back in 2004. Named by Wired as one of the UK's top 100 digital power-brokers. Lives in London.

Co-founded Berg with [Matt Webb](#Matt Webb)

>I co founded Ottica with Timo Arnall in October of 2014, most recent work is on Project Soli for Google. Previously I co founded the design company Berg where I led design and invention work. Projects I led include Here & There, Mag +, iPad light painting, Little Printer, Immaterials: Ghost in the feild and Nearness, Suwappu, Cloudwash, and Lamps.

If you've got a mo, check out his [MIT video](http://www.media.mit.edu/events/2013/08/01/media-lab-conversations-series-jack-schulze) where he describes many of the ideas behind the innovation at BERG.

I found the comment from the interviewer particulary revealing when he referred to the 'face' of little printer bringing a quality to the product. Jack summed this quality up as the pairing of technology with *humanity*.
