Their communication are a bit sparse and the Medium and Twitter aren't regurlary updated so it's hard to tell how the company is going.

## Vanishing Elephant
Vanishing Elephant is a Sydney based brand designed by Felix Chan, Huw Bennett and Arran Russell. In 2008 the trio decided to join forces with the singular vision of creating a line committed to producing clothing of real quality, purpose and originality.

Making their mark with a classic aesthetic, each collection heralds a return to gentlemanly style with an undeniable modern twist. Further cementing the labels swift rise to the forefront of Australian menswear, November 2010 saw the label being awarded Designer of the Year at the prestigious GQ Men of the Year Awards in Sydney. Another milestone in the label's progression was in September 2011 with opening of the first VE store in Melbourne's QV Centre.

HYPE has become the UK’s most inspiring story of student entrepreneurship. When Aidy Lennox and Liam Green started the fashion brand in 2011, few could have predicted that retail giants including Topman, Footasylum and Asos would join the ride.   
Liam Green was only 17-years-old when HYPE was born, preparing to begin university at De Montfort in Leicester, where he’d start to realise his ambitions as a graphic designer. However after an initial investment of £400 between Liam and his partner Aidy resulted in the first wave of HYPE designs selling out within hours, both realised that bigger things were on the horizon.

Love his twitter. He looks like an authentic mess, or exactly what you'd expect from a rich teenager.
